# suitelife
In 2012, 34% of Millennials were living with housemates. This consistent market of people in communal living situations would benefit from more organization and collaboration. SuiteLife aims to assist with group living by offering a resource to easily share food and shopping responsibilities, something that most people do inefficiently. SuiteLife provides a simple interface to track individual and group needs as well as accrued costs between members. 

 This project was developed by a 2017 Harvey Mudd Summer Startup Team.
